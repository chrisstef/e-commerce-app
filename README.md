# Ecommerce app


## Project Description 

This e-commerce application includes modern design and animations, the ability to add and edit products on the go using Sanity for a database, advanced cart, checkout functionalities, and most importantly, the complete integration with Stripe to cover real payments.

In this app we are using:
- Advanced React techniques such as folder and file structure, hooks, and refs.
- Advanced State Management of the entire application with React Context API.
- Next.js Best practices such as file-based routing, server-side rendering and static generation.
- Stripe to manage payments, products, shipping rates, and the entire checkout process.

Most importantly, we manage the entire content of our app using Sanity.
Sanity is an unified content platform that will make the making of our entire app possible.

This is a [Next.js](https://nextjs.org/) project bootstrapped with [`create-next-app`](https://github.com/vercel/next.js/tree/canary/packages/create-next-app).
